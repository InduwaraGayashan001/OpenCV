# OpenCV

This repository contains a variety of image processing and computer vision tasks implemented using Python and OpenCV. Each task demonstrates a specific concept or technique useful for building a foundational understanding of OpenCV.

- [**Image Representation**](Images.ipynb) : Pixel representations, merging/splitting channels, color spaces, and conversions.
- [**Image Manipulation**](Image_Manipulations.ipynb) : Accessing and modifying pixels, cropping, resizing, and flipping.
- [**Image Annotation**](Image_Annotation.ipynb) : Drawing lines, circles, rectangles, and adding text on images.
- [**Image Enhancement**](Image_Enhancement.ipynb) : Brightness and contrast adjustments, bitwise operations.
- [**Image Filtering**](Image_Filtering.ipynb) : Blurring techniques, Canny edge detection, and basic feature detection.
- [**Image Alignment**`](Image_Alignment.ipynb) : Matching keypoints and estimating homography for alignment.
- [**Camera Access**](camera.py) : Accessing and displaying camera output in a local environment.
- [**Video Processing**](Video_Writing.ipynb) : Reading from and writing to video files, and displaying them.
- [**Panorama Creation**](Panorama.ipynb) : Keypoint matching, pairwise correspondence, homographies, and image stitching with blending.
- [**HDR Imaging**`](HDR_Imaging.ipynb) : Image alignment, camera response function (CRF) estimation, merging exposures, and tone mapping.
